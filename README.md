# ZIM Farm
A farm operated by bots to grow and harvest new zim files. There are three main components:

- Dispatcher
- Broker
- Worker

Technology used

- Docker
- Python 3.5, Angular
- Flask, Celery & RabbitMQ
- SQLite

## Stage 1: Simple async task with Docker

Goal: create a system that handles addition of two numbers asynchronously

- one dispatcher, one broker and one local worker
- WebAPI to enqueue a new task and query task status by ID
- run with one `docker-compose` command

### Steps to run

1. make sure docker and docker-compose are installed on your system
2. clone this repo
3. make sure you are in master branch
4. open a terminal session change directory to root of this repo
5. `docker-compose up --build`
6. wait for docker to do its job

### Enqueue a new task

Now, you could try to enqueue a task by sending a request like this: 
```
curl http://localhost:80/task/delayed_add -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"x":4,"y":10}'
```
If everything is correct, you will be able to get the following response:
```
{
  "task": {
    "id": "252b6354-a06f-426c-8dff-529845e88bf6",
    "name": "delayed_add",
    "status": "PENDING"
  }
}
```

Meanwhile, in terminal, you should be able to see things like this:
```
worker_1      | [2017-04-27 18:08:32,595: INFO/MainProcess] Received task: delayed_add[e926fd8e-d0a7-492b-a566-dde46c91d502]

```

### Check task status

At any time, you could query a task's progress using its ID.
```
curl http://localhost:80/task/status/252b6354-a06f-426c-8dff-529845e88bf6
```
You should be able to see the following response:
```
{
  "id": "252b6354-a06f-426c-8dff-529845e88bf6",
  "result": 14,
  "status": "SUCCESS"
}
```

## Note: Useful commands
- remove all containers: `docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`
- remova all untagged images `docker rmi $(docker images -a | grep "^<none>" | awk "{print $3}")`
